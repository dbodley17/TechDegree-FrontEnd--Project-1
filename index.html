        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web developer who loves the concept of creating websites and web apps from scratch. I grew up in a small city not really knowing what i wanted to do when I grew up. I currently work as a General Manager of Jiffy Lube and hold certificates as a ASE certified technician.</p>
        <p>I became interested in code when I was offered a part time position with the community college near me as a Web Designer and learned a little bit of HTML and CSS on the fly. After I left the college to take on a full time job where I am currently at I never took the time to expand my knowledge in coding until now.</p>
